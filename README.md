# SIMPaCT demo data

This repository contains example volumetric water content (VWC) data from a test deployment of **13 soil moisture sensors** in Bicentennial Park, Sydney, Australia.  
The dataset supports the experiments described in our paper on mutual-information-based virtual sensor prediction.

## Dataset Description

### sopa.csv

Raw sensor readings in CSV format.

**Columns:**

* `index` — Row index from original database extract
* `stream` — Sensor identifier and measurement type
* `value` — Volumetric Water Content (VWC) measurement (%)
* `datetime` — UTC timestamp of measurement in ISO format

**Example:**

```csv
index,stream,value,datetime
13716,meshnet.bicentennialpark.SoilMonitor.SENS0020-SM-SOPA.VWC,8.289648879,2022-11-15 00:07:24.245000+00:00
13717,meshnet.bicentennialpark.SoilMonitor.SENS0020-SM-SOPA.VWC,8.364618613,2022-11-15 00:22:24.475000+00:00
...
```

### sopivot+idx.csv

Processed dataset where sensor readings are pivoted into columns, with timestamps aligned to a regular grid and indexed.

Preprocessing steps:
  - Resampled to hourly cadence (mean over hour).
  - Indexed by timestamp.
  - Sensor IDs simplified to `SENSxxxx`.

**Example:**

```csv
datetime,SENS0018,VWC_SENS0018,SENS0023,VWC_SENS0023,...
2022-11-15 00:00:00,8.30,8.29,7.12,7.14,...
...
```

### Generated Analysis Files

The `mi_*` files in `data/` are generated by our mutual-information analysis pipeline.
They store intermediate and final outputs used to build the MI-based virtual sensor prediction models.
These files are included here to enable reproducibility of the results in our paper.
They can be regenerated from sensor data, but may look slightly different each time due to inherent nondeterminism of the approach.

## Time Span

- Start: 2022-11-15 00:00 UTC  
- End: 2023-01-17 15:00 UTC  
- Frequency: Hourly (processed) / Irregular (raw)

## Sensor IDs

SENS0008, SENS0010, SENS0012, SENS0017, SENS0018, SENS0019, SENS0020, SENS0021, SENS0022, SENS0023, SENS0027, SENS0028, SENS0030.

## Usage Example

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/sopivot+idx.csv", parse_dates=["datetime"], index_col="datetime")

# Select two sensors
sensor_a = "SENS0018"
sensor_b = "SENS0023"

# Plot their VWC over time
df[[sensor_a, sensor_b]].plot(title="Soil Moisture Sensors")
```

## Additional Requirements

The mutual information analysis uses the amazing [Java Information Dynamics Toolkit (JIDT)](https://github.com/jlizier/jidt) via `jpype1`.

Download the JIDT jar file (that is the `infodynamics.jar` file) from the [JIDT releases page](https://github.com/jlizier/jidt/releases) and place it in the `code/` directory or update the script path accordingly.

With the intermediate `mi_*` files present, the toolkit is not strictly required to reproduce the graphs, but for any new data you will need it.
